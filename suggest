There are some nameing problems in your code
1.The meaning of function named like 'parseData'(in CascadePicker.js) is realy ambiguous.
Name function like 'adjustPosition'(in PickerColumn.js) is more specific and we can know 
what the funcion does just from the function name.

2.The property name onOk is also bad.Maybe 'onSelectComplete' is better.

Your classNames function is useful.But it may not need to push Number type class name into the array.
I didn`t see any CSS class name like 1 or 2.

Who write the CSS file weui.css and the related components?
